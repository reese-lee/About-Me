    <h2>Who is Reese?</h2>
    <h3>A Whirlwind "About Me" Primer</h3>
    <img src="img/reese01.jpg" alt="Reese Lee climbing Mt Hood" width=500px">
    <p>Reese is someone who enjoys talking in the third person about herself, but as this can be a little awkward, I will now switch to first person.</p>
    <p>I am originally from Malaysia, a lush, tropical country near the equator. I have lived in Oregon for almost half my life now, and have never been as pale as I am now.</p>
    <p>I reside in SW Portland with my boyfriend, Dominic Montelongo (who is also a student in this class!), and our three pets: Egg, Cocoa, and Kong.
    </p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>I have a Bachelor's degree in Magazine Journalism and a professional background in retail management, and currently own two creative small businesses. I have been self-employed for the last six years as an artist making jewelry and chubby animal illustrations, and I plan on continuing them as side hustles during my coding career.</p>
    <p>While I love my small businesses and do enjoy the artist life, I wanted something with more stability. By chance, a friend of mine stopped by my booth at the Portland Saturday Market. I remember she had gotten into software development, and asked her about it.</p>
    <p>After seeing her enthusiasm, I researched coding careers and Epicodus, which is where she graduated from last year. Two days later, I signed up for the same bootcamp, and here I am creating this page to tell you this high-rollicking tale of forgotten toads and magical swans.</p>

<!-- Github Projects and individual project "about"s -->

    <h2>Github Projects</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3><a href="">Vacation Site</a></h3>
        <p>This <em>simple yet powerful</em> page is about one of my dream vacation countries, Turkey. I created this along with my partner Darrion Gering using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Word remains out on the jury as to whether turkey is, indeed, available in Turkey.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3><a href="">Wikipedia Rebuild</a></h3>
        <p>This is my first attempt at recreating another web page. <strong>One might call me a regular Steve Jobs.</strong> My partner Darrion Gering and I built this exact replica of the world-renowned Wikipedia page utilizing our expert knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. (Ok, I may be exaggerating slightly, but I am very pleased with the tabs we created.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3><a href="#">Lady Coders Blog</a></h3>
        <p>In a small effort to increase diversity in the tech world, my partner Heather Zurek and I made a blog about our journey as coding students. So far, we are still in Week 1, but <span class="extra">we are determined to make it</span>! We made this using HTML and CSS.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3><a href="#">Heather & Reese's Animal Shelter</a></h3>
        <p>This site showcases some of <span class="super">the finest animals available in the adoption world today</span>, housed at the shelter my partner Heather Zurek and I built. We used HTML and CSS to create this heartwarming site.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3><a href="#">Cupcake Shop</a></h3>
        <p>Here we have some gourmet cupcakes for sale (but not really, please do not place an order at this time). My partner Heather Zurek and I created this page using HTML and CSS to build excitement about our entry into the cutthroat cupcake world.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

      <li>Taking care of my plant babies</li>
