    <h2>Who is Reese?</h2>
    <h3>A Whirlwind "About Me" Primer</h3>
    <img src="img/reese01.jpg" alt="Reese Lee climbing Mt Hood" width=500px">
    <p>Reese is someone who enjoys talking in the third person about herself, but as this can be a little awkward, I will now switch to first person.</p>
    <p>I am originally from Malaysia, a lush, tropical country near the equator. I have lived in Oregon for almost half my life now, and have never been as pale as I am now.</p>
    <p>I reside in SW Portland with my boyfriend, Dominic Montelongo (who is also a student in this class!), and our three pets: Egg, Cocoa, and Kong.

<!-- Github Projects and individual project "about"s -->

    <h2>Github Projects</h2>

    <h3><a href="">Vacation Site</a></h3>
    <p>This simple yet powerful page is about one of my dream vacation countries, Turkey. I created this along with my partner Darrion Gering using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Word remains out on the jury as to whether turkey is, indeed, available in Turkey.</p>

    <h3><a href="">Wikipedia Rebuild</a></h3>
    <p>This is my first attempt at recreating another web page. One might call me a regular Albert Einstein. My partner Darrion Gering and I built this exact replica of the world-renowned Wikipedia page utilizing our expert knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. (Ok, I may be exaggerating slightly, but I am very pleased with the tabs we created.)</p>

    <h3><a href="#">Lady Coders Blog</a></h3>
    <p>In a small effort to increase diversity in the tech world, my partner Heather Zurek and I made a blog about our journey as coding students. So far, we are still in Week 1, but we are determined to make it! We made this using HTML and CSS.</p>

    <h3><a href="#">Heather & Reese's Animal Shelter</a></h3>
    <p>This site showcases some of the finest animals available in the adoption world today, housed at the shelter my partner Heather Zurek and I built. We used HTML and CSS to create this heartwarming site.</p>

    <h3><a href="#">Cupcake Shop</a></h3>
    <p>Here we have some fine cupcakes for sale (but not really, please do not place an order). My partner Heather Zurek and I created this page using HTML and CSS to build excitement about our cupcake venture.</p>
